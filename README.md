This artifact accompanies the tool paper titled “GALTOSM: A Graph and Logic Transformation Based Toolkit for Software Model Checking”, submitted to `ATVA 2025` with submission number `5790`. It includes all necessary source codes and a reproduction package supporting the claims made in the paper. Reproducing the case studies requires model checking tools such as `CADP (version 2024-k ”Eindhoven”)` and `STORM (version 1.9.0)`. Although the toolkit also supports integration with PRISM and mCRL2, these tools are not directly involved in the results claimed in the paper.

There are no strict hardware requirements to run the toolkit; machines with higher capacity can process larger models, while lower-capacity systems may be limited to smaller ones. We have carried out all the case study experiments in an `Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS` machine with `CPU Intel® Xeon(R) Silver 4314 CPU @ 2.40GHz × 64 and 640.0 GiB, 1TB, primary and SSD memory`.

This artifact contains a `README.txt` file and a `READ DIRECTORY.pdf` file in every directory for better understanding. The source code is well commented and the README files describe the alignment of the source code with the objective and the functionalities provided by the tool.
