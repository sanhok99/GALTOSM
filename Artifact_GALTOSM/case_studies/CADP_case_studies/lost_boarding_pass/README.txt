FOLDER DETAILS
_____________________________

This folder contains the the model of the lost boarding pass problem problem written in LNT and saved as '.lnt'.

For each filename 'bp_$PASSENGER.lnt' the $PASSENGER represents the Number of people boarding the plane.

These '.lnt' files are compiled by the CADP to generate the ADTMC in '.aut' format and '.mcl' file dtores the specification.


STEPS TO CREATE ADTMC AND MODEL CHECK IN CADP:
_________________________________________________
1)Make sure the environment variables of CADP are set.
	export CADP=$BASE_DIRECTORY/cadp
	export CADP_BITS=64
	export CADP_MEMORY=50000000000
	export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:$CADP/com:$CADP/bin.x64
	
2)change directory to the location having all the '.lnt' files

3)RUN THE COMMAND: lnt.open bp_102.lnt generator bp_102.bcg (to get the time put 'time' in front of the lnt.open)
	You will get a '.bcg' file with the name 'bp_102' in the same location.
	
4)RUN THE COMMAND: bcg_io bp_102.bcg bp_102.aut
	You will get a '.aut' file in the same location. which is a human readable file.
	
5)RUN THE COMMAND: sed -i 's/ !/; prob /g' bp_102.aut
	All the '!' mark will get replaced by '; prob' in the '.aut file

Now this 'bp_102.aut' is an ADTMC which will be provided as input to GALTOSM's model translator tool. (which are also provided in $BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases)

step 6 and 7 is for model checking in CADP
6)RUN THE COMMAND: bcg_io bp_102.aut bp_102.bcg
	This will replace the previous '.bcg' file which was present previously with the '.bcg' of the modified '.aut' file.
7)RUN THE COMMAND: bcg_open bp_102.bcg evaluator5 bp_property.mcl
	This will return the probability value after model checking along with the result.
------------------------------------------------------------------



MCL of APCTL:
______________
We have expressed our requirement using the APCTL formula in the file 'bp_property_APCTL.txt'. Since CADP model checking requires '.mcl' file for the specification. We have written MCL5 equivalent formula of the APCTL formula in the 'bp_property.mcl' file.

For the logic translator tool of GALTOSM we have used the same APCTL logic to get the corresponding PCTL logic.

GALTOSM EMBEDDING OF MODELS AND LOGIC
______________________________________

	MODEL EMBEDDING
	----------------
		The models(.aut) generated by CADP are provided in the directory $BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/adtmc_to_sdtmc
		which can be given as input in the GALTOSM's model translator tool and obtain(in the same location) the .lab and .tra of the SDTMC
	
	LOGIC EMBEDDING
	---------------
		The logics are provided in the case_study folders and also in $BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/example_logics,
		these can be converted using the logic translator tool of the GALTOSM.
		
	Now we have translated model in the form of (.tra and .sta) and a state logic, we are ready for state model checking.

STORM MODEL CHECKING(explicit)
_______________________________

STEPS:
		1) Make sure that that the ADTMC(.aut) has been convered to SDTMC(.tra .lab) the details of which is provided 
		there($BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/adtmc_to_sdtmc)
		
		2) Make sure you have the translated logic which is available in 
		$BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/example_logics
				NOTE: the " sent through the arguments needs \ in front them
				
		3) Make sure that STORM is installed 
		
		4) change directory to /home/user/storm-stable/build/bin
		
		5) RUN THE COMMAND 
				./storm --explicit <location_of_tra> <location_of_lab> --prop "logic"
				
				The below example command is for the ant on a grid in a 8X8 grid and the probability that it eventually LIVES
				
				./storm --explicit $BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/adtmc_to_sdtmc/bp_102.tra $BASE_DIRECTORY/Artifact_GALTOSM/GALTOSM_tool/test_cases/adtmc_to_sdtmc/bp_102.lab --prop "(P=?[((\"bot\"&(true))|(!(\"bot\")&(true)))U((!(\"bot\")&(\"LAST_GOT_SEAT\"))&P>=1[X(\"bot\"&(true))])])"
